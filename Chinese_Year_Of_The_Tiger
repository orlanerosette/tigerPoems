A creature of ferocity the tiger, 
but also a creature of beauty and assurance, stripes shining bright,
stalking prey to devour, its  an incredible sight,
Padding on large paws, green, frenzied  eyes
big belly, lying  on back, contented deep sighs.

Fearless. bold, loyal, confident, will overcome it's difficulties,
She called its name, it appeared, shedding all of its ferocity,
great strides will be made in the year of this cat,
qualities that  far outweigh those born in the year, say of the rat.
